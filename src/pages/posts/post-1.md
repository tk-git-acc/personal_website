# Setting up my personal portfolio website using Astro

Published on: 2025-08-19

This is my first blog post, where I am setting up my website using Astro.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post. I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts.

## What's next?

Next I will look at styling and adding more content to my site.
