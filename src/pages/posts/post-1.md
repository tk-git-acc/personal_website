# Getting started building my website with Astro

Published on: 19/07/2025

This is my first blog post, where I am setting up my website using Astro.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: Created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts & environment.

2. **Making Pages**: Learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post. I now have Astro pages and Markdown blog-posts.
