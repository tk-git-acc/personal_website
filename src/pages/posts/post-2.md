In my second day of working on my new personal portfolio Astro website, I added to the site by:

1. Adding components for re-used HTML - for example, the footer, header, navigation and social elements.

2. Creating the global.css and different types of styling. This allowed me to, for example:

    * Create more of a button look and feel for the navigation & social media links.
    * Add hover effects for buttons for both ease of use and accessibility.
    * Add support for different screen sizes using the media CSS feature.
    * Centre the navigation bar element.

3. Adding more dynamic features, such as utilising the title from the frontmatter of each of the .md files for the post title on my blog page. I also added the date as a pre-fix for each of the posts. This meant that it is more clear what each post includes, as well as when it was published, without having to go into the blog post.
